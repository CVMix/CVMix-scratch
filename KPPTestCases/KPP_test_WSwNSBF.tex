\chapter{Wind-stress with negative surface buoyancy forcing
   (WSwNSBF)}

 These tests are configured with a wind stress providing mechanical
 mixing that is countered by generally non-negative surface buoyancy
 forcing realized by a heat flux.  Since the buoyancy forcing is
 generally positive (stabilizing), these tests only exercise the local
 downgradient diffusive portion of KPP.  In this way, the tests are
 very simple.  In turn, the tests provide a useful means to ensure
 that implementation details are consistent across models making use
 of CVMix/KPP.
