\chapter{Wind stress with zero buoyancy forcing}
\label{chapter:wind_alone}

In this chapter, we document a test case configured with a constant
zonal wind stress 
\begin{equation}
 \bftau  =  (0.1, 0)~\mbox{N}~\mbox{m}^{-2}
\end{equation}
and zero heat flux
\begin{equation}
Q=0~\mbox{W}~\mbox{m}^{-2}.
\end{equation}
The temperature is initialized with a stable linear stratification
according to equation (\ref{eq:linear-stratification}).  This test
ilustrates how mechanical forcing induces mixing into vertically
stratified water.  This test furthermore exercises only the local
downgradient diffusive portion of KPP, as the non-local KPP term
vanishes with a zero surface buoyancy flux.  Although somewhat
trivial, this test has proven useful for ensuring that implementation
details are consistent across ocean models making use of CVMix/KPP.

\section{Results from GFDL-MOM6}
\label{section:wind_only_mom6}

Figure \ref{fig:MOM6_SST_bldepth-wind_alone} shows the KPP boundary
layer depth and mixed layer depth realized from the MOM6
implementation of CVMix.  The boundary layer deepens in time, due to
the mechanical forcing from winds that eats away at the vertical
stratification.  Correspondingly, the SST cools as mixing entrains
cooler water from below.  Note how the mixed layer depth closely
follows the SST, whereas the boundary layer depth oscillates according
to the inertial oscillations.  Furthermore, note the plateaus
exhibited in the KPP boundary layer depth, particularly by the
$10~\mbox{m}$ simulation.  Such behaviour is discussed in Appendix D
of \cite{LargeKPP}.  The plateaus are less visible in the mixed layer
depth.

As furthermore discussed in Appendix D of \cite{LargeKPP}, there is a
dependence on vertical grid resolution in Figure
\ref{fig:MOM6_SST_bldepth-wind_alone}, with deeper boundary layer and
cooler SST found as the vertical grid coarsens.  The reason for the
cooler SST with coarser grids is that the KPP vertical diffusivity is
directly proportional to the boundary layer thickness, which is seen
in the lower panels of Figure \ref{fig:MOM6_SST_bldepth-wind_alone}.
Hence, deeper boundary layers produce more vertical mixing of warm
surface waters with cooler deeper waters, thus producing cooler SSTs
and warmer interior waters.  This mixing is further seen from the
depth profiles of temperature in Figure
\ref{fig:MOM6_temp-wind_alone}.  With coarser vertical grids and the
associated enhanced vertical mixing, there is an enhanced surface
cooling and deep warming relative to results from the fine vertical
grids.

Inertial oscillations in the zonal velocity are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:MOM6_zonal-wind_alone}.  The amplitude of the oscillations is
enhanced as the vertical resolution is refined.  The oscillations
impart an oscillation in the vertical shear, which in turn impacts on
the boundary layer depth.  This is the primary reason that the
boundary layer depth shows oscillations in Figure
\ref{fig:MOM6_SST_bldepth-wind_alone}.
