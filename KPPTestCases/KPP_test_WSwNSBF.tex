\chapter{Wind-stress with negative surface buoyancy forcing
   (WSwNSBF)}

 These tests are configured with a wind stress providing mechanical
 mixing along with a generally non-positive surface buoyancy forcing
 realized by a heat flux.  Since the buoyancy forcing is generally
 negative (de-stabilizing), these tests exercise both the local
 downgradient diffusive portion of KPP and the non-local transport
 term.
